# 30m-annual-NDVI-calculation-from-2000-to-2023
The calculation of NDVI for small island developing states from 2000 to 2023 mainly consists of two steps. The first step is the calculation of the GF-SG spatio-temporal fusion basic NDVI dataset, and the second step is the calculation of the optimized NDVI dataset based on the basic NDVI dataset. The specific code is as follows:

First:
The basic annual NDVI for the years 2000 (inclusive) to 2012 (inclusive): https://code.earthengine.google.com/2559e60695d52f899df25ce893ae1812
The basic annual NDVI for the years 2013 (inclusive) to 2023 (inclusive): https://code.earthengine.google.com/8939453586b9d019b0224c7481c89d48
